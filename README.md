4. Set yo Git shit up

5. rails generate controller pages home
* add in the address when you run the server url/pages/home
* this command creates a controller and a view for this url address
* to undo/remove this run 'rails destroy controller pages'

6. set the home route in config/routes.rb 
* the home view from the pages controller will be added in here
* replace this with root pages#home to set the homepage to our generated homepage

7. set the page in the pages controller like so

	def about 
	end 

8. make a new view with the same naming convention

12. Page partials
* views/layouts/application.html.erb is the main application file
* make files like _nav.html.erb and save it into the layouts folder
* then use <%= render 'layouts/nav' %> to render that partial

13. Adding attributes to links like so
	
	<%= link_to "link text", "link location", class: "class-name-here" %>


14. Make development, text and production versions in Gemfile
* made two group blocks like so
	group :development, :test do
		gem 'sqlite3'
	end
* this makes a development and testing version for local use
* then make a production block too
